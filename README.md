### Overview

For a better visualization of this project, please see the project in this link: [Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandravlezrodas/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis).

Cyclistic is an enterprise which inaugurated a bicycle-sharing initiative in 2016. Since its inception, the program has expanded to encompass a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, each equipped with geotracking capabilities and securely integrated into a network of 692 stations spanning Chicago. These bicycles can be accessed from one station and conveniently returned to any other station within the system at any given time. Notably, Cyclistic distinguishes itself by offering a range of specialized bicycles, including reclining models, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. This commitment to inclusivity extends the benefits of bike-sharing to individuals with disabilities and those who may face challenges with conventional two-wheeled bicycles.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has so far focused on creating general awareness and appealing to a wide consumer base. This was facilitated by offering flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are those who opt for single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members are considered Cyclistic members. 

Financial analysis has demonstrated that annual members yield higher profits compared to casual riders. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that prioritizing the conversion of casual riders into annual members is crucial for future growth. She emphasizes that casual riders are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen it for their transportation needs.

### Business task
Analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ and use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

The insights of this analysis will help the Cyclistic marketing analyst team to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members and provide the Cyclistic execute team with valuable information to assist their data driven decision making process regarding future marketing campaigns.

### Data sources:
This analysis is for case study 1 from the Google Data Analytics Certificate **"Cyclistic bike-share"**
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends, which is the City of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service data made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This public data can be accessed online. 

I will analyze the data from October 1st 2022 to September 30th 2023.

The purpose of this notebook is to consolidate downloaded Cyclistic data into a single data frame and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”
